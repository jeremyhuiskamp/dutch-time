A very simple browser-based application that displays random times on a clock and the Dutch sentence expressing that time.  Allows beginners to practice reading time with feedback.

Uses SVG to draw the clock.  This seems to work in all major browsers except IE and I'm not sure it would even work there with an SVG plugin.
